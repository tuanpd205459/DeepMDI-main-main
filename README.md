## Overview

This project presents a novel approach for high-precision phase demodulation from two-frame interferograms using a two-step neural network architecture based on NAFNet. The method combines self-supervised learning with physics-informed model-driven training to achieve accurate phase retrieval from interferometric data.

## Architecture
![Framework Overview](framework.png)

The proposed method consists of two sequential networks:

- **PNNet (Pre-training Normalization Network)**: A self-supervised network for data normalization and pre-processing
- **UMNet (Untrained Model-driven Network)**: A physics-informed network for phase retrieval that incorporates physical constraints

## Requirements

### Python Dependencies
```bash
torch
torchvision
numpy
opencv-python
matplotlib
pandas
```

### MATLAB
- MATLAB R2019a or later
- Image Processing Toolbox

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd model-driven
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy opencv-python matplotlib pandas
```

3. Ensure MATLAB is installed with required toolboxes.

## Usage

### Training

The training process consists of two sequential steps:

#### Step 1: Pre-training PNNet (Normalization Network)
```bash
python train_PNNet.py
```
This step trains the normalization network using self-supervised learning to prepare the data for the subsequent phase retrieval step.

#### Step 2: Training UMNet (Model-driven Phase Retrieval Network)
```bash
python train_UMNet.py
```
This step trains the phase retrieval network using physics-informed loss functions and the pre-trained PNNet weights.

### Inference

The inference process follows the same two-step approach:

#### Step 1: PNNet Prediction
```bash
python predict_PNNet.py
```
This generates normalized interferogram pairs from the input data.

#### Step 2: UMNet Prediction
```bash
python predict_UMNet.py
```
This performs phase retrieval from the normalized interferograms, producing wrapped phase maps.

#### Step 3: Phase Unwrapping
```matlab
main_unwrap
```
Run this MATLAB script to unwrap the phase maps and calculate error metrics.

## Dataset Format

The dataset should be organized as follows:

```

│   ├── frame2/          # Second interferogram frames (training)
│   ├── frame1_n/        # Normalized first frames (ground truth)
│   ├── frame2_n/        # Normalized second frames (ground truth)
│   └── phi/             # True phase maps (ground truth)
└── simu_test/
    ├── frame1/          # First interferogram frames (testing)
    ├── frame2/          # Second interferogram frames (testing)
